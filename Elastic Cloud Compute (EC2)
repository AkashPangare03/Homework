A hypervisor is a virtualization platform. 
Types include Type 1 (bare-metal, like Xen, VMware ESXi) and Type 2 (hosted, like VMware Workstation, VirtualBox).
4.Where we use hypervisor
Hypervisors are used in virtualization environments, managing multiple virtual machines on a physical host.
5.Steps to create an EC2 instance.
Steps include navigating to the EC2 console, launching an instance, choosing an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), 
configuring instance details, adding storage, and configuring security groups.
6.EC2 Instance state ?
The state of an EC2 instance can be pending, running, stopping, stopped, shutting down, or terminated.

The global view option in EC2 is available in the EC2 Dashboard, allowing users to view resources across all regions.
13.When we logged into the cloud account by default why do we always jump into the north virginia region, why it’s most popular ?
AWS defaults to the North Virginia (us-east-1) region upon login, often because it was the first region and remains widely used, offering a comprehensive set of services.
14.What are EBS Volumes and its types ?
EBS (Elastic Block Store) provides persistent block-level storage for EC2 instances. Types include General Purpose (SSD), Provisioned IOPS (SSD), and Magnetic.
15.Purpose of Using EBS volumes ?
EBS volumes provide scalable and durable storage for EC2 instances, offering high performance and reliability.
16.How many types of purchasing options do we have in aws ec2 ?
Purchasing options include On-Demand Instances, Reserved Instances, and Spot Instances.
17.Difference between AWS AMI Image & AWS Template ?
An AWS AMI (Amazon Machine Image) is a pre-configured virtual machine image. 
An AWS Template is a broader term and can refer to CloudFormation templates used to create and provision AWS resources.
18.What is NIC & it’s types ?
NIC is a hardware component that allows computers to connect to a network. Types include physical and virtual NICs.
19.What is elastic IP ? & WHY were we used ?
An Elastic IP is a static IP address assigned to an AWS account, allowing users to mask the failure of an instance by remapping the address to another instance.
20.What is the snapshot of why we use it ?
A snapshot in AWS is a point-in-time copy of an EBS volume. It is used for data backup, recovery, and migrating data between regions.
21.How can we save money in snapshot costing, if an automated snapshot has been created ?
Money can be saved by managing snapshot costs through efficient use of Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager, which automates the creation and retention of snapshots.
22.What is the lifecycle manager in snapshot ?
The Lifecycle Manager automates snapshot creation, retention, and deletion, streamlining the backup process and reducing costs.
23.How does the Amazon lifecycle manager work ?
Amazon Lifecycle Manager automates the creation and deletion of EBS volume snapshots based on user-defined schedules and retention policies.
24.Difference between Security Group & NACL ?
Security Groups are stateful, operate at the instance level, and control inbound/outbound traffic. 
NACL (Network Access Control List) is stateless, operates at the subnet level, and controls traffic at the protocol and port level.
25.What are NACL & Its types ?
NACL is a security layer for controlling inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level in AWS VPC. Types include custom and default NACLs.
26.How many IP Addresses can we attach to the instances ?
Instances in AWS can be associated with private and Elastic IP addresses. The number of private IPs varies by instance type.
27.How many types of volume states do we have ?
EBS volume states include creating, available, in-use, deleting, deleted, and error.
28.What is a key pair, and its types ?
A key pair in AWS is used for secure SSH access to instances. Types include EC2 key pairs and Elastic Beanstalk key pairs.
29.What is load balancer and its types ?
A load balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances. 
Types include Classic Load Balancer, Application Load Balancer (ALB), and Network Load Balancer (NLB).
30.How does the load balancer work in the backend? Can you explain it ?
In the backend, a load balancer distributes incoming requests to healthy instances based on configured rules, ensuring even traffic distribution and high availability.
31.Features of Load Balancers ?
Load balancer features include automatic scaling, SSL termination, cross-zone load balancing, and health checks for efficient application delivery.
32.What is ASG ? & Its types ?
ASG automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances in a group based on demand. Types include simple scaling and step scaling.
33.What is a Health Check ?
A health check in ASG determines the health of instances, allowing ASG to replace instances that fail the health check.
34.What is the threshold ?
Threshold in ASG is the limit at which the ASG triggers a scaling action, either scaling out or scaling in.
35.What is the group of LB ?
A group of LB refers to the set of load balancers configured to distribute traffic across multiple instances for high availability and fault tolerance.
35.Why do we prefer ALB over ALB ?
ALB (Application Load Balancer) is preferred over ELB (Classic Load Balancer) due to its advanced features like content-based routing, SSL termination, and WebSocket support.
36.Difference between Web server & Application server ?
A web server handles HTTP requests and responses, serving static content, while an application server runs application logic, handling dynamic content and business logic.
37.What is the target group ?
A target group is part of an ALB configuration, defining a set of targets (EC2 instances) for routing traffic based on rules and conditions.
38.What is the desired capacity in ASG ?
Desired Capacity in ASG represents the ideal number of instances that should be running at any given time, ensuring the group's specified capacity.
39.How many types of the Scaling option ?
Scaling options include manual scaling, scheduled scaling, and dynamic scaling based on policies and metrics.
40.Scaling plans ?
Scaling plans are predefined strategies for automatically adjusting the capacity of an ASG based on application and infrastructure needs.
41.Types Auto scaling?
ypes of auto scaling include horizontal scaling (adjusting the number of instances) and vertical scaling (changing the instance size).
42.Difference between vertical scaling and horizontal scaling ?
Vertical scaling involves increasing the capacity of an existing instance, while horizontal scaling adds more instances to distribute the load.
43.Difference between AMI & Snapshot ?
An AMI is a machine image containing an operating system and application, while a snapshot is a point-in-time copy of an EBS volume, often used for backups.
44.What is difference between EBS/EFS/S3?
EBS (Elastic Block Store) is block-level storage for EC2 instances, EFS (Elastic File System) is scalable file storage, and S3 (Simple Storage Service) is object storage for scalable data storage.
