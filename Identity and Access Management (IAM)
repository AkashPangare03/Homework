How many resources do we have in IAM ?
IAM (Identity and Access Management) in AWS provides resources like users, groups, roles, policies, and identity providers.
Deployment model in IAM ?
IAM is a service within AWS, and its deployment model is intrinsic to AWS's overall cloud deployment.
Identities in IAM ?
Identities in IAM include users, groups, and roles, which are entities associated with AWS accounts and control access to AWS resources.
What is an IAM User ?
An IAM user is an entity that represents a person or service and is used to interact with AWS resources. 
Users have credentials (username and password or access keys).
What is the IAM Group ?
An IAM group is a collection of IAM users. 
Groups are used to simplify the management of permissions by allowing you to assign policies to a group of users.
What is the IAM Policy ?
An IAM policy is a document defining permissions. It specifies what actions are allowed or denied on what resources. 
Policies can be attached to users, groups, or roles.
What is the IAM Role ?
An IAM role is similar to a user but is assumed by anyone who needs it for a specific set of tasks, providing temporary access. 
Roles are often used in cross-account access scenarios.
Where do we attach Identity Based Policy ?
Identity-based policies are attached to IAM users, groups, or roles.
Where do we attach Resource Based Policy ?
Resource-based policies are attached directly to resources, specifying who has access to the resource.
Can we be able to create Policy via json code ?
Yes, IAM policies can be created using JSON code to define the permissions and resources.
If one user has created it by default, which permission has been assigned to that user ?
When a user is created, they have no permissions by default. 
Permissions must be explicitly granted through policies.
What is dominator policy ?
The Policy that overlap otherpolicy is called dominator policy.
For example If a user has S3 full access and it ids added to a group whichn has S3 only read access than the S3 full access is dominator policy. 
What is ARN ? What are the fields in ARN ?
ARN is a unique identifier for AWS resources. 
Fields include the partition, service, region, account ID, resource type, and resource-specific qualifiers.
How many types of ARN Partition ?
AWS ARNs can be in aws, aws-cn (China), aws-us-gov (AWS GovCloud), or custom partitions.
What are Tags ?
Tags in AWS IAM are key-value pairs that can be attached to IAM users, groups, roles, and policies for better organization and resource management.
