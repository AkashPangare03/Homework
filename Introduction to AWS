What is cloud computing ?
Cloud computing is a technology that allows users to access and use computing resources 
(like servers, storage, and software) over the internet, instead of relying on local servers or devices.
Deployment Model in Cloud ?
Cloud deployment models include Public Cloud (accessible by the public), Private Cloud (restricted access for a single organization), 
Hybrid Cloud (combination of public and private), and Community Cloud (shared by specific communities).
Service Model in Cloud ?
Cloud services are categorized into Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS), 
representing different levels of abstraction and management responsibilities.
Architecture of Cloud Computing ?
Cloud computing architecture consists of front-end and back-end components. 
The front-end includes user devices and interfaces, while the back-end comprises servers, storage, and a network managed by cloud providers.
AWS Global Infrastructure Count ?
AWS has multiple data centers across regions globally, with over 80 availability zones.
Why do we use region ?
Regions in cloud computing, like AWS, provide geographical diversity and redundancy. 
Using multiple regions enhances fault tolerance, reduces latency, and complies with data sovereignty regulations.
What is service ? & What are resources ?
In cloud computing, a service refers to a set of functionalities provided over the internet, like computing power or storage. 
Resources are the underlying components that make up these services, such as virtual machines, databases, or networking components.
