1.What is VPC ?
VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):
VPC is a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources. It enables customization of the network configuration, IP address range, and subnets.
2.What are the Subnets when working with VPC ?
Subnets are segments of IP address ranges within a VPC. They are used to organize resources, and instances in different subnets can communicate with each other.
3.What is NAT Device ?
A NAT (Network Address Translation) device allows instances in a private subnet to initiate outbound traffic while preventing incoming traffic initiated from the internet.
4.What is the difference between stateful & stateless filtering ?
Stateful filtering tracks the state of active connections, allowing return traffic automatically. 
Stateless filtering evaluates each packet individually, without considering the state of the connection.
5.What are the advantages of using default VPC ?
Default VPC simplifies deployment by providing predefined settings. 
Instances launched in the default VPC have internet connectivity by default, easing initial configuration.
6.What is the internet gateway in VPC ?
An internet gateway allows communication between instances in a VPC and the internet. It serves as a gateway for outbound and inbound traffic.
8.What is Network ACL in VPC ?
Network Access Control List (ACL) acts as a stateless firewall for controlling traffic in and out of subnets within a VPC.
9.What is the Security Group in VPC ?
A Security Group acts as a virtual firewall for instances. It controls inbound and outbound traffic, providing a stateful filtering mechanism.
10.What is an Elastic IP Address in VPC, and why do we need to use, realtime example ?
An Elastic IP is a static IPv4 address for dynamic cloud computing. 
It's used to mask the failure of an instance and ensures a consistent IP address for an EC2 instance. 
For example, it's beneficial for hosting a website with a consistent IP.
11.Can we attach one Production Elastic IP to the new Prod server ?
Yes, we can attach an Elastic IP from one instance to another, allowing a smooth transition between servers while maintaining a fixed IP address.
12.How does ELB Affect a VPC ?
Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances. It improves the availability and fault tolerance of applications within a VPC.
13.What are the limitations of VPC’s, Gateway and subnets ?
Limitations include quotas on VPCs, subnets, and internet gateways. There are also restrictions on modifying certain settings after VPC creation.
14.What is a Public IP Address and why do we use it ?
A Public IP Address is used to identify a device on the internet. It enables communication between devices across the global internet.
15.Explain Bastion Host Concept ?
A Bastion Host is a specially configured instance that allows secure access to private instances within a VPC. It acts as a gateway for SSH or RDP access.
16.When do we need to create a new customised VPC ?
Create a new customized VPC when specific network configurations are needed, such as distinct IP address ranges, different routing policies, or specific connectivity requirements.
17.What is Peering ? Why do we need to peer at two VPC’s ?
Peering connects two VPCs, allowing them to communicate as if they were on the same network. 
It's needed for resource sharing, application migration, or interconnecting environments.
18.What is VPN, Where do we use VPN Tunnel ?
A VPN establishes a secure connection between two networks over the internet. VPN tunnels are used to ensure encrypted and private communication.
VPN tunnels are used to create secure connections between on-premises data centers and AWS VPCs, ensuring private and encrypted communication over the internet.
